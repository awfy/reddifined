# Reddifined

Redefining how Reddit looks. An extension for Google Chrome.

### Requirements

##### 1. Reddit Enhancement Suite
Reddifined is coded purely to work with the Reddit Enhancement Suite. [Download](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) the latest version for your browser to make sure it works perfectly.

##### 2. Disable Custom Styles
This is a temporary requirement whilst I implement enough overwriting CSS to prevent them from breaking everything. For now though, navigate to your [preferences](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs) on Reddit and uncheck _"allow subreddits to show me custom styles"_.

### Installing as Chrome Extension

1. Download the repo to your machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to your Extensions.
3. Make sure "Developer mode" is checked in the top right of the page.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." then open the main directory of the Reddifined folder.
